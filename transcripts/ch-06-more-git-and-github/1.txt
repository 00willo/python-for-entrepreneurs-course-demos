00:01 We got our first taste of git and github in the previous chapter,
00:04 and we have a little bunch of monotonous one time setup where we installed git, 
00:06 signed up for github and configured our account so that everything was connected. 
00:10 With all that out of the way, we're going to get more hands on with git in this chapter. 
00:14 First, we're going to take a look at the git commands, 
00:18 git add, commit, status, push, pull, remote and a few others. 
00:21 These are the basic building blocks of git that allow us 
00:24 to use it as a version control system. 
00:26 Source control is critical even if you're working on your project by yourself, 
00:30 if you're working with others, we're also going to cover 
00:33 collaborating with other github users, we'll add collaborators to our repository, 
00:36 and take a look at how pull requests and issues work. 
00:39 Learning about collaborating through github will set us up great for later on, 
00:42 in one of the chapters where we take a look 
00:44 at working with other people on our businesses. 
00:47 Most of our time in the videos in this chapter are going to be spent on the command line, 
00:50 it's better to get comfortable with all the git commands on the command line first, 
00:53 because that's really where you're going to be working most of the time. 
00:56 But we'll also take a look at graphical user interfaces, these guis are clients 
00:59 that can make some confusing tasks easier by providing visuals 
01:02 that make it easier to understand the outcome of the commands we're trying to run. 
01:06 Those are the three primary objectives for this chapter. 
01:09 I also recommend that you take some time each day to practice using git 
01:13 so you can build your muscle memory, 
01:15 so the git is a tool that boosts your productivity rather than getting in your way 
01:18 whenever you are trying to get something accomplished. 
01:21 Both Michael and I have been using git for the last several years 
01:24 and I can say with experience, when you use it regularly the tool becomes second nature to you
