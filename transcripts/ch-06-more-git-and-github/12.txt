00:01 All these git commands can get a bit confusing, 
00:03 so it's helpful to have a user interface through a desktop application 
00:06 to help you manage all of your changes in git, 
00:09 in this video we'll take a look at one of those desktop applications, 
00:12 there are many of them out there but SourceTree 
00:15 which is made by Atlassian is one of the best. 
00:17 We'll download, install, and set up SourceTree with our github account, 
00:20 so we can get a little bit of extra help managing our git repositories. 
00:23 The first step to get SourceTree is to get a sourcetreeapp.com and download it for mac, 
00:28 of whichever operating system that you are working on, once that's saved, 
00:32 we can open it up, once it's extracted install it, 
00:35 either by dropping its applications or through the installer if you're on windows.
00:40 Once it's installed, we can open it up, and if you get a confirmation just click open, 
00:45 now we do need to use an Atlasian account in order to log in here, 
00:50 but we're going to connect this to github instead. 
00:53 So, if you don't have an Atlassian account, go to atllasian.com and sign up for one, 
00:58 just  a free account, once you've got that in place, 
01:01 we'll say use an existing account and we can log in, okay, now we're registered, 
01:06 and we can set it up, click github and we're going to use the oauth authentication, 
01:11 we'll connect our account, if you enable too factor authentication, 
01:16 you'll need to get the verification code, punch that in and you should be verified, 
01:21 well to give it access to some of our account, 
01:23 including both public and private repositories, 
01:27 and we'll have it generate an ssh key for us. 
01:30 Click copy to keyboard, awesome, so now it's listing all the repositories
01:38 that we have got associated with our account, and this may take a few minutes, 
01:42 once the list is populated, we can click on a specific repository, 
01:46 and we can also search so I'll search for full stack python 
01:51 and we can specify where we want to clone that repository. 
01:55 For now I'll just put this under my home directory. 
01:58 Since I already have most of my repositories on my local system instead of cloning one, 
02:02 I am going to just add it based off of the files that are in my local file system,
02:05 now there is a few ways we could do this,
02:09 one way is just to drag and drop into the tool from the finder 
02:11 or we can click scan a directory, alright, now I've added full stack python, 
02:15 this allows us to work with all of our git history within a nice graphical user interface 
02:21 instead of just using the command line. 
02:24 To be honest, I don't really use gui tools all that much, 
02:27 I tend to stay right on the command line and you can do everything you need to do 
02:30 on the command line, but especially when you're learning all these commands together, 
02:34 it can be helpful to have this tool and essentially it's going to run the commands 
02:37 behind the scenes for you. I won't go into all the features, 
02:40 that source tree offers but I will show you that you can compare various commits
02:44 you can see what's changed, in each of those commits and just in general,
02:49 as you start to add commits to your project for your business, 
02:52 there is a nice way to go through everything just in case you've introduced the facts 
02:55 and you need to fix them, go back and see what's changed, those sorts of tasks. 
02:59 That is a real quick overview, of how you can sue gui tools, 
03:01 like source tree in order to manage and view 
03:04 all the changes you're making to your projects through git.
