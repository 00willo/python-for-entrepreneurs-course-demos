00:01 We learned the conceptual idea behind git add and git commit. 
00:04 Let's dive back into the command line, so we can test out the git add command. 
00:07 I am in the Python For Entrepreneurs course demos git repository. 
00:11 But there is nothing that's changed in this repository
00:13 so when I run the git status command it tells me that there is nothing to commit. 
00:16 This repository contains all the source code for the entire course 
00:20 and if you look at all the directories, you'll see the example code, 
00:23 for each of the chapters, now this chapter on git doesn't have any example code 
00:27 but I am going to add some resources that I think are really useful 
00:30 when you're getting started with git. 
00:32 I am going to create a new directory, this will be for chapter six, 
00:36 we'll move in, and I am going to create a resources file. 
00:40 We'll just add a single resource to this file for now, 
00:45 that way we can test the git add command. 
00:49 
00:56 This is just a link to the Full Stack Python source control 
00:59 page that has many resources, not only for git 
01:02 but for the general source control concept as well. 
01:05 We'll save this file and then quit out and now when we type git status, 
01:09 we'll see that we have a single file that needs to be changed, 
01:12 but it seems a little odd, it's not pointing to this specific file 
01:15 that we just created resources.markdown, what git is telling us 
01:18 is that there is actually a new directory that has files within it that needs to be added, 
01:21 I'll move up one directory, and now I'll explicitly specify 
01:25 we want to add the git resources directory. 
01:28 When we type git status, we'll see that there is a new file in a new directory 
01:31 that needs to be committed to the repository. 
01:34 We've set up the file for staging, what happens if we accidentally added this 
01:37 to our staging area, that is where the git reset command comes in handy, 
01:41 we can type git reset head and now, we're back to where we were before, 
01:45 there is a new directory, a new file, but they are not in the staging area. 
01:49 We'll add this again and this time we'll use the period which says 
01:52 add every single change that is from this directory 
01:55 and every subdirectory within this directory. 
01:58 Git status command, and now we're ready to commit this file
02:02 and the new directory, but we'll handle that in the next video.
