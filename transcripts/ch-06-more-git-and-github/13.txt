00:00 We've gone through a lot in the past two chapters on git and GitHub, 
00:02 let's just take a few minutes to summarize what we went over at high level. 
00:05 First we dug into git command such as git add,
00:09 to add modified files to a staging area, 
00:12 git commit, which actually commits them to the index for git, 
00:15 git status, which allows us to see what's been modified since our last commit, 
00:19 git log which shows us all the commits that have done 
00:23 throughout the entire history of our git repository, 
00:25 and git push and git pull to move files to and from local and remote repositories. 
00:30 As I've said a few times throughput the course of these videos 
00:33 these are all the building blocks for using git 
00:35 and while you need to become comfortable with each one, 
00:38 they really work together in combination, with git in our tool belt, 
00:41 we're able to use GitHub to collaborate with other users on our projects, 
00:44 in some cases, this will just mean that people can file issues tickets 
00:48 against bugs they found in your application. 
00:50 Other times, you will actually be working with people on code, 
00:53 where you will be pushing and pulling from the repository 
00:56 and while git and GitHub can be overwhelming for non developers, 
00:58 you can also use gui tools such as Source Tree to make it easier 
01:02 to add and modify files that you're working on others with. 
01:05 As I said at the start of this chapter, you really need to have daily practice 
01:09 with each of these commands in order to build muscle memory. 
01:12 get in the good habit of making small commits at a time, 
01:15 pushing them up to your repositories on GitHub and in general, 
01:18 make it a part of your daily workflow as you're building your projects. 
01:20 Now what do you do if you get stuck? 
01:23 Well, here is some more resources to help, 
01:25 there is a couple of pages that I work on constantly on fullstackpython, 
01:27 which are source control and get, and this will provide many more 
01:31 tutorials and resources and additional context for what these tools can do for you. 
01:35 Now, if either of these pages, or any page on full stack python 
01:38 doesn't have what you're looking for, you can file an issue ticket 
01:41 at the URL you see here, whatever questions you have about using git and source control, 
01:45 I'd love to be able to answer them on these pages 
01:47 so that not only you can get the answer that you need, 
01:50 but also anyone else who is reading full stack python and of course,
01:53 you can ask questions on twitter, either myself 
01:56 @fullstackoython or Michael on @talkpython. 
01:59 Git can take a while for you to wrap your head around what is happening, 
02:02 but once you get comfortable with it, it's a really great safety net for your projects, 
02:05 where you know that your code is not only backed up, 
02:08 but you can also roll back to early versions in case you accidentally introduce bugs 
02:12 or just need to see what changed. With that, let's keep working on our projects.
