00:00 Time to take a quick look at url structure. I say quick look for a reason. 
00:04 I want to keep this as simple as possible, let's look in an example. 
00:08 If you go in Full Stack Python, and you click on any of the pages 
00:12 that are listed in the all topics, for example, web frameworks, 
00:15 we can see the url up here at the top, there are no subfolders 
00:19 between the base url fullstackpython.com and this particular page,
00:23 it's a simple url as possible with perhaps the .html. 
00:27 Now, the .html provides no penalty 
00:31 so whether you have a clean url with or without that, 
00:33 for example, if we just had web frameworks, be the same thing, 
00:36 and I suggest for each of your pages don't nest more than one folder deep 
00:40 so what do I mean by folder? 
00:43 I created a blog last year and this is for specific topics, 
00:46 the blog top of the page is not in our folder, but when you click on an individual post, 
00:50 you will see that it is under the blog folder, 
00:53 some blogs have the month and year listed for example 
00:58 let's say it's 2017 and it's December, and this would create a new url structure 
01:04 where you actually nested four levels deep. 
01:07 So blog 2017, December I strongly recommend against doing that, 
01:11 there actually is a penalty the further down something is nested. 
01:15 The reason behind that is, the further something is nested, 
01:18 it seems like it's less important 
01:20 so it's less likely to appear at the top of the search results. 
01:23 It's also just a longer url, keep your urls as short as possible, 
01:26 while still maintaining all of the keywords that you want people 
01:30 to find your content when they search for those keywords, 
01:34 now a couple of other simple rules, you'll see 
01:36 that I have how to make phone calls in Python as the full title but the url 
01:40 only has make phone calls Python, and that is because the filler words 
01:44 like two, in, a, and, don't need to be in your url, just keep it to the keywords. 
01:50 I could have just as easily said how to make phone calls Python 
01:54 but I kept it as short as possible, short urls are better not only for search rankings, 
01:59 but also if someone wants to give the url directly to someone else
02:03 they don't have to use a url shortener like bitly 
02:06 in order to send over something that is not a gigantic piece of text. 
02:09 So keep the slug, what is often referred to as the slug, 
02:13 as short as possible, for the content that you create.
02:15 This is one that you don't need to overthink, make sure that the fully qualified url 
02:19 is only one folder deep in the url and keep that slug simple with the keywords 
02:24 that you are targeting and remove any extraneous words 
02:29 like and, to, the, from the url. 
02:32 By following those simple rules, very clean urls, 
02:35 they are more likely to appear at the top of the search results.
