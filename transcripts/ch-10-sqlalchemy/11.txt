00:01 Okay so how do we use this? Well, there is a couple of things we need to do, 
00:04 one our database is empty, so we are going to need
00:08 to insert some data, that's interesting, 
00:10 two we are going to need to query the data 
00:13 and I think it will be more fun and have a little more dramatic effect 
00:16 if we write up the code to query the data we'll see there is nothing there 
00:20 and then when we actually insert it it will immediately appear. 
00:23 So let's go back to our albums controller here 
00:25 and have a quick look remember we wrote this method here long ago, 
00:29 I am sure it feels like a long time ago and we have this album service, 
00:33 and this is a design pattern I love to use for these ORMs. 
00:37 The ORM deals with mapping, classes directly to and from the database
00:43 but there is often times more applications scale sort of things are happening, 
00:49 well, I want to join with this or any time I query one of those
00:52 I want to make sure I also update over here  those types of things. 
00:55 So I am very keen to have these service things, right, 
00:59 so services, these are the applications view of accessing the data, 
01:04 you don't work directly in the ORM, you can if you want 
01:07 but we are going to go over here and work like this, 
01:10 we have a function called get albums, 
01:12 so you can see this is the old get albums, remember we had this fake data, 
01:16 we are going to have a new one here. 
01:18 So what we are going to do is we are going to go and do a query 
01:22 so let's say like this, we are going to need to get a hold of one of these sessions, 
01:26 and again, this is going to be db session factory 
01:29 and we are going to need to import that and I don't really like this factory factory 
01:33 let's give this a function over here, 
01:36 so we come down here def make this a static method as well, 
01:41 and we'll call this create session, something like this. 
01:48 and we'll just return like so, okay, a so instead of doing this 
01:51 we can do something a little more obvious like create session 
01:54 and then our goals are going to be to get the data from the database, 
01:58 so how do we do this? 
02:00 What we are going to do is we are going to be able to create queries 
02:03 from these sessions, so we are going to say session.query 
02:05 and we give it the type that we want to work with, 
02:08 in this case we want to query an album, and of course, 
02:11 we are going to need to import this, maybe we want to do some kind of filtering, 
02:14 like let's see I changed the album just a little bit here to have an is published. 
02:18 And this will let us do some kind of interesting queries 
02:21 if we don't have too much data, so we come over here 
02:24 and we'll do a query and we'll say something to the effect of filter album, 
02:29 now, this is what's cool about ORM is you get to express the queries, 
02:33 this is kind of the where clause if you will, 
02:35 in terms of the classes so I can say is published, 
02:40 leave it alone like that or == true however you want. 
02:44 A lot of times these get kind of complicated, 
02:46 you might want to do them on multiple lines, so we are going to say order by, 
02:50 maybe we want to order by album.year, where is year, there is year, 
02:57 so we want to order by album.year 
02:59 and maybe we want to actually show the newest ones first, 
03:02 let's be a little consistent there, 
03:04 notice how pyCharm puts little line continuation for us, thank you, 
03:07 so this is pretty straightforward, order by, 
03:11 but what do I do if I want to order by descending, 
03:14 I can tell you already, there is not a order by des OK, 
03:17 this is the only order by function we have. 
03:19 so it's not entirely obvious but we can come over here 
03:22 and on these we have like descending, ascending,
03:25 like for substring matches, there is all sorts of interesting functions 
03:28 on these columns that you can do filtering or ordering by. 
03:32 Okay, so this is going to give us basically a result, 
03:36 a set of results here, or leave it like that.
03:41 Now, we can go over here and we can say things like .all 
03:46 and that will snapshot into a list but if we don't do that here 
03:50 we just have an iterable that's still running across the database, 
03:54 we haven't actually returned anything yet, 
03:57 so we are going to need to somehow do that. 
04:00 so let's go ahead and do that, if our goal really is just to return a list, 
04:03 we don't want to return this results 
04:06 which still kind of partially tie to the database, 
04:09 we'd like to snapshot that like this, come over here say .all 
04:15 and then return albums. 
04:19 Okay, so that means outside of this function 
04:21 there is going to be no more data access, 
04:24 it's not like a dangling open session sort of issue going on, 
04:27 okay, so this should run and it should give us back nothing, 
04:31 because there is no data in our database,
04:33 but let's do one thing so we can actually see what is happening. 
04:36 Remember, our engine, it has an echo, not there, our engine, 
04:40 our engine has an echo, and we can say echo=true 
04:44 and this will turn on all the debug output, 
04:47 when I run it you should see a bunch of stuff. 
04:50 Hopefully, I haven't mess anything up we are about to find out.
04:53 So notice all this output, that's not an error, 
04:57 that's sqlalchemy looking at the tables trying to understand 
05:00 tell me about the album, tell me about the track, okay? 
05:03 That's from echo=true. Now, we go over here, 
05:06 this is all well and good but if I hit this album's button, 
05:09 or navigation item here, we are going to go run that query 
05:12 and let's see what happened. 
05:14 So check this out, begin implicit transaction select, 
05:17 just refer to this as star, right this is all the columns--- I come down here, 
05:28 from album, where album is published, order by album year descending. 
05:34 How cool is that, let's go back and look at what we wrote. 
05:38 Session query album filter album is published, 
05:41 order by album year descending, right, there is album year descending 
05:44 and then we snapshot that into a list. 
05:48 Right, so we came back we passed that off to our view, 
05:51 our view said let's loop over it, oh, there is actually nothing here.
