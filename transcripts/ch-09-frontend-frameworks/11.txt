00:01 Now let's look at one final thing before we leave our example here. 
00:04 Notice this is light across the top, and if you look up here, 
00:07 you can see that I have a propensity for dark navigation across the top. 
00:11 Not, always, one of my podcasts is all about the white 
00:14 but I kind of like this dark style when I am doing developer type stuff,
00:18 I know this is like a podcast where developers come,
00:21 we all like dark themes- not all of us, many of us like dark themes,
00:24 so how do we do that?
00:26 Well, it turns out to be super easy. 
00:29 If we come over here, we can say instead of navbar default, 
00:33 we can have navbar inverse, now if I just do that, and refresh this page, 
00:36 now you can see we have a nice dark version and everything inverses itself. 
00:41 It's really great, but notice there is something weird going on,
00:44 and this makes no sense to me why Bootstrap does this, but they do it.
00:48 Look, really carefully here, zoom your eyes up here into the corner. 
00:53 Notice, rounded edges, like what the heck? Why would rounded edges be here?
00:58 I think they just kind of overdid it on the rounded edges when it comes to navigation. 
01:02 Like it just doesn't make any sense to me, 
01:05 it seems like it should be a bar across the top. 
01:08 Never mind, we can fix that really easily. 
01:11 So up here, we can see .navbar has border radius like that, 
01:17 let's copy this, and here is the way I like, 
01:20 any time I'm overriding a Bootstrap theme, 
01:23 instead of sticking this into my main site, 
01:26 what I would do is I would have a style sheet like this, 
01:29 I always put this right after Bootstrap. 
01:33 I can call it something like Bootstrap overrides
01:37 so, any time you want to change the default behavior Bootstrap put it there
01:41 if it's not specifically about your site,
01:43 so you kind of know like what themes of what things am I doing 
01:46 specifically to sort of be part of or counteract what Bootstrap is doing. 
01:51 So let's put this here and we want of course zero,
01:54 now we are going to need to include that 
01:57 (Michael typing)02:04 so Bootstrap overrides thank you PyCharm. 
02:07 Now if I go back over here, refresh, 
02:10 so much better, you can see down here somewhere,
02:13 this is the border radius that came from Bootstrap 
02:16 but the Bootstrap overrides said no, no, no, no- stand back, 
02:20 we're putting zero here and if you look carefully again
02:23 now it looks more like you might expect.
